                <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<li>How do I save?</li>
<ul>Make sure you're logged in and have adBlock disabled. <b>Right click</b> the portrait of the slot you want to 
    save and click "Save As".
</ul>
<li>I need more slots!</li>
<ul><u><a href="https://genshinimpactcalculator.com/premium.htm">Premium for donors here.</a></u>
</ul>
<li>Why is the calculator's damage different from my actual?</li>
<ul><b>You probably forgot to check "Use Enemy Calc" (in <i>Enemy Modifiers</i>).</b> The calculator only calculates raw
    damage by default, because damage changes depending on who you're hitting. If you want to know
    how much damage you deal to a specific enemy, you need to check "Use Enemy Calc" and then designate
    the enemy you are hitting with the appropriate settings (i.e. level).
</ul>
<li>I checked "Use Enemy Calc" but the damage is still wrong!</li>
<ul>Make sure your artifacts/weapons are correct by comparing the displayed stats to
    the in-game stats. Check to make sure all the buffs are properly toggled on or off, depending on
    your situtation. Also make sure your talent levels are all correct and that the enemy's level
    and resistances are properly set. Small discrepancies are likely rounding error. If you are
    inbetween levels,
    e.g. level 71, the calculator's values might be off by a bit since it only has data for every 10
    levels (e.g. 60, 70, 80).
    If there is still a discrepancy, please raise the issue in the discord with a detailed account of
    the problem (i.e. share
    your build).
</ul>
<li>X buff isn't being applied!</li>
<ul>Make sure you've toggled the buff if it is applied conditionally. A large majority of buffs
    are applied conditionally, and will thus <b>need to be toggled by clicking a checkbox</b>.
</ul>
<li>Why is the optimizer recommending X?</li>
<ul>The optimizer only does the math for you (theoretical optimum) and then outputs a list of results. <b>The output is there so that the user can make sense of the results</b>. 
    Oftentimes, the "best" result isn't practical (e.g. thundersoother, lavawalker). Other times, when the top results are tied, a random one is selected as the "best". <b> READ THE OUTPUT </b>
</ul>
<li>What is DPS/Total DPS?</li>
<ul>The DPS stat is the normal attack DPS, which is based on the full normal attack combo time, without animation cancelling.
    The Total DPS is normal attack DPS + any DPS from the bonus hits of weapon abilities.
</ul>
<li>What about Charge Attack 1/2?</li>
<ul>Charge Attack 1 is the non-fully charged aimed shot for Bow users, or the spin attack for claymore users. 
    Charge Attack 2 is is the fully charged aimed shot for Bow users, the final hit of a spin attack for claymore users, or just the charged
    attack you'd expect for other weapon users. Note that for Ninguang, her damage per jade with her charge attack is Charge Attack 1, while her normal
    charged attack is Charge Attack 2.
</ul>                <h2 id="build-slots">Character Build Slots</h2>
                <span>Left Click a character portrait or an empty slot to set the character for that slot.</span>
                <li>A new empty slot will always be created after you set the character for the previous empty slot.
                </li>
                <li>All the settings, including <i>Enemy Modifiers</i> and <i>Party Buffs</i>, are saved <b>per Slot</b>
                </li>
                <li>You can Right Click (long press for mobile) a potrait and select <b>Copy to Empty Slot</b> to copy
                    the
                    build into the next empty slot (the new copy will be unnamed, so you will have to <b>Save As</b>
                    manually
                    before it can be shared).</li>

                <h2 id="basic-settings">Basic Settings</h2>
                <span>The Damage column will occasionally show options that can be checked or selected (to activate
                    conditional passives/constellations/artifact set effects).</span>
                <li>You can set your character's constellations and level and your stats and passives will be
                    automatically
                    populated. </li>
                <li>Normal attack/Skill/Burst talent levels must be filled in manually (constellations that give +3 to
                    a talent will not be applied automatically, you should add 3 to the talent level yourself).</li>
                <li>Select your weapon, refinement level and weapon level. If the weapon has an ability, it will be
                    applied at whatever refinement level you selected. Some ability effects will show extra options
                    under the description of the ability (e.g. toggle conditional effects, set number of stacks of a
                    buff).</li>
                <li> Some weapon abilities give you <i>Bonus Hits</i>. The damage for those hits will be displayed
                    under the <i>Bonus Hits</i> category. If your weapon has <i>Bonus Hits</i>, a <i>Total DPS</i> stat
                    will
                    be displayed in the Damage Column which is the Total of your normal attack <i>DPS</i> and the DPS
                    from your <i>Bonus Hits</i> (i.e. the <i>Total DPS</i> is your total normal attack dps).
                </li>
                <li>Artifacts can be set by choosing an Artifact Set, which will determine the rarity (e.g. 3 star or 4
                    star) that is
                    available for that artifact piece (some sets are max 4 star while some are minimum 4 star) as well
                    as the number of possible starting Initial Substats.</li>
                <li>After selecting the rarity, the upgrade level of the artifact can be set which will determine
                    the value of the artifact's main stat.
                    You can also change the main stat type for artifacts that
                    have more than one main stat type available.
                </li>

                <li>Note: Substats cannot be of the same type as the artifact's main stat (the calculator currently does
                    not check whether this is the case).

                <span>The Damage Calculator can also calculate actual damage dealt to an enemy (as opposed to
                    theoretical damage) and consider buffs/effects provided
                    by other members of you party.
                </span>
                <li>The <i>Enemy Modifiers</i> and <i>Party Buffs</i> Categories start off collapsed. Click the category
                    to expand and view the settings.</li>
                <li><i>Enemy Modifiers</i> allows you to enable <b>Use Enemy Calc</b>, which will make the damage values
                    displayed in the Damage Column be the mitigated damage taken by the Enemy. The settings for the
                    Enemy
                    are contained here.</li>
                <li><b>REMEMBER:</b> Defense or Resistance reduction won't affect the damage output unless you enable

                </li>
                <li>Elemental reactions such as vaporize or melt can be triggered by setting the enemy to <b>Affected
                        By:</b>
                    a certain element. If the character's damage element would trigger a reaction, the damage shown will
                    reflect that. Note that
                    if your normal attack combination is all elemental, the DPS will be artificially high, as if you
                    triggered the melt or
                    vaporize reaction on every hit (even though the CD for the reaction won't actually allow every hit
                    to trigger the reaction). However, you will be able to see the damage of each hit if it triggered
                    the reaction.</li>
                <li>Note that certain reactions like overloaded or electrocharged are treated as separate hits. The
                    damage
                    for these reactions are showed separately under <i>Elemental Reactions</i> and not added to the
                    damage
                    values displayed for other stats.
                </li>
                <li><i>Party Buffs</i> contains settings for Elemental Resonance and any other buffs that could
                    potentially
                    be applied by party members. This includes other character buffs or debuffs as well as artifacts or
                    weapons
                    equipped by other party members.</li>
                <li>Some buffs/debuffs provided by other characters are based on their stats or talent levels. If that
                    is the case,
                    there will be input boxes for you to enter those values in manually.
                </li>
                <li>Some buffs/debuffs are indented/nested within another toggleable effect. E.g. Bennett's inspiration
                    field
                    has two other buffs nested underneath it. The nested effects are effects that would only be applied
                    if you
                    had a certain constellation/passive that enabled those effects. The calculator doesn't check to make
                    sure
                    you are only checking the nested effects when the outer effect is checked, so you should do make
                    sure to do that on your own.
                </li>

                <h2 id="reaction-mode">Reaction Mode</h2>
                <li><b style="color:white;">"Reactionless"</b> damage is the average crit
                    damage, not taking into
                    account any elemental reactions (this is be the value that used to be in the
                    "Average" column, unless the reaction type is Melt or Vaporize).
                </li>
                <li><b style="color:white;">"With Reaction"</b> damage is the average crit
                    damage while taking into account any
                    elemental reaction that is proc'd (for Melt or Vaporize this is the value
                    used to be in the "Average" column).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The new <b style="color:white;">"Average"</b> damage column displays the
                    average damage based on the
                    "Reaction Proc Chance". Thus, if I expect Fischl's "E" to proc an elemental
                    reaction like Overloaded about 50% of the time,
                    the "Elemental Reaction Proc Chance" will be 50. If I expect it to proc an
                    elemental reaction every time, I would set it to 100. If this value is 0,
                    then the calculator does not switch into "Reaction Mode".
                </li>
                <li><b style="color:white;">"Elemental Reaction Proc Chance"</b> is the % of
                    hits I'd expect to proc an elemental reaction.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <b style="color:white;">IMPORTANT:</b> Since the "Reaction Mode" relies on
                    elemental reactions, "Use Enemy Calc"
                    MUST be toggled on, in order for "Reaction Mode" to be of any use. The enemy
                    MUST also be "Affected by:" a certain element.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b style="color:white;">When to use:</b> This setting is useful for
                    figuring out whether you should focus
                    on Elemental Mastery. This setting forces the optimizer to consider whether
                    Elemental Mastery (and therefore Reaction Damage) will give you a bigger boost
                    than attack based damage (e.g. atk%, crit, crit dmg, dmg bonuses).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b style="color:white;">How to use:</b> Even though this setting converts
                    all damage stats to "Reaction Mode",
                    its primary use is to allow you to focus on optimizing a single stat. For
                    example:
                    If I am trying to optimize Fischl's "E" skill, I would set the "Optimize For"
                    setting to "Freikugel". Normally, the optimizer would focus on only atk, crit,
                    or
                    electro dmg values, since that is what is used to determine the "Freikugel"
                    stat.
                    However, by turning on "Reaction Mode" while the enemy is affected by Pyro
                    Damage,
                    the Optimizer will now add Elemental Mastery into the equation because the
                    "Reaction Mode"
                    "Freikugel" stat, now includes damage from Overloaded.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The optimizer always optimizes the targeted stat's "Average" damage. So the
                    optimizer basically assumes that
                    the Target Stat will proc elemental reactions at a frequency of "Elemental
                    Reaction Proc Chance".

                </li>
                <li>Note that this means if you originally <b>Load Build</b> into a slot, then decide to work on another
                    build, and change
                    the character in that slot, sharing the build in that slot will overwrite the named build you
                    originally loaded. </li>
                <li>(e.g. Load "KeqingBuild1" into Slot 0 -> Change the character in Slot 0 to Diluc -> Work on Diluc's
                    build -> Share Slot 0 -> "KeqingBuild1" will be overwritten
                    with Diluc's data.</li>
                <li>To avoid this, either remember to start new builds in new slots or <b>Save As</b> before using
                    <b>Share Build</b>

                    people see
                    as long the build has the same name.

                    the optimizer
                    because the optimizer is pretending that you have 100% crit).
                <li>Often the best option will actually
                    be second or third in ranking, or you may not have the BIS item. Please make sure you check

                <li>The <i>Optimize for</i> setting allows you to designate the <i>Stat</i> that you want to maximize.
